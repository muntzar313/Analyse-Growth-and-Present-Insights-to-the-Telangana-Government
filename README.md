# Analyse-Growth-and-Present-Insights-to-the-Telangana-Government
**Telangana is one of the fastest-growing states in India and one of the states with an open data policy.** 

Peter Pandey is an aspiring data analyst looking for a project with real-time data to add to his portfolio. He wanted to analyze Telanganaâ€™s growth among different sectors quantitatively and provide useful Insights to the Telangana government that would help them to make data-informed decisions that would further support the growth of the state.

Peter Pandey began this project by drafting some of the key objectives for this analysis.

**Primary Questions**

1 Stamp Registration

* How does the revenue generated from document registration vary across districts in Telangana? List down the top 5 districts that showed the highest document registration revenue growth between FY 2019 and 2022.
* How does the revenue generated from document registration compare to the revenue generated from e-stamp challans across districts? List down the top 5 districts where e-stamps revenue contributes significantly more to the revenue than the documents in FY 2022.
* Is there any alteration of the e-Stamp challan count and document registration count pattern since the implementation of the e-Stamp challan? If so, what suggestions would you propose to the government?
* Categorize districts into three segments based on their stamp registration revenue generation during the fiscal year 2021 to 2022.

2 Transportation
* Investigate whether there is any correlation between vehicle sales and specific months or seasons in different districts. Are there any months or seasons that consistently show higher or lower sales rates, and if yes, what could be the driving factors? (Consider Fuel-Type category only)
* How does the distribution of vehicles vary by vehicle class (MotorCycle, MotorCar, AutoRickshaw, Agriculture) across different districts? Are there any districts with a predominant preference for a specific vehicle class? Consider FY 2022 for analysis.
* List down the top 3 and bottom 3 districts that have shown the highest and lowest vehicle sales growth during FY 2022 compared to FY 2021? (Consider and compare categories: Petrol, Diesel, and Electric)
